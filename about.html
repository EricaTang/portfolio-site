					Hi, I'm Erica and I'm striving to become a multimedia designer that focuses on graphic design, motion design, UI/UX design, and more. My passion for discovering and creating aesthetically pleasing art and design began at a young age, and I continued to draw inspiration from my daily life to this day. I'm currently pursuing an interdisciplinary education in Economics, Psychology, and Interactive Design and Media at New York University. This diverse background has given me a unique perspective and a broad range of skills that I can bring to any project. I enjoy the creative process of ideating, designing, and refining my work, and I'm always excited to learn new techniques and tools along the way. Don't hesitate to reach out with any inquires or ideas!
